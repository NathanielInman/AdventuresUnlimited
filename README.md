## Items For Leveling
Keep in mind that the intention for this is **not** to be a comprehensive list of items, but the **best-in-slot** leveling items. Adventures Unlimited has a huge focus on tradeskills, where created items will always be the strongest items for each level tier group (armor is crafted for levels 10, 20, 30 etc.) But if you're leveling quickly, don't have access to an armorsmith or simply the crafted item isn't as strong as it could be, these are great fall-back options.

### Light Items
