## Stances
Stances take exactly 25 improvements to advance in skill level and have 9 ranks of mastery. You can rank up a stance every level. You can grandmaster 1 stance per 8 levels. This limit disappears at level 50. You can therefor unlock grandmaster stance and grandmaster it at level 50. You can reach this goal even if you train no stances until level 50 as it is accumulatively unlocked.

Every hit has a possibility to check for improvement:
```
percent chance (0-100): 4 * int + level) / 10
```

If possibility is unlocked it checks for improvement:
```
apprentice: 75 - 100%
trainee: 50 - 75%
student: 25 - 50%
fairly experienced: 1 - 25%
well trained & above: 1%
```

1. apprentice
2. trainee
3. student
4. fairly experienced
5. well trained
6. highly skilled
7. expert
8. master
9. grandmaster
